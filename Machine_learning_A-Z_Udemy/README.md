# Machine_learning_A-Z_Udemy
Code and information of the machine learning course :D

## A little of history

- From the dawn of time to 2005, humans had generated 130 exabytes
- From the dawn of time to 2010, humans had genrated 1,200 exabytes
- In 2015, humans had generated 7900 exabytes
- In 2020 it is expected that humans will have generated 40,900 exabytes

## 6 Extra about instructors and stuff

- **Super datascience podcast O.o**: https://www.superdatascience.com/sds-002-machine-learning-recommender-systems-and-the-future-of-data-with-hadelin-de-ponteves/
- **What is Machine Learning**: 
	Can be used for: 
	- Predictions
	- Discover logic in a field (clustering and segmentation)
	- Interactive machine learning (choose best adds at the right moment, reinforcement learning)
	- Deep learning.
	- Big science that englobes many fields (AI can be defined the same way as artificial intelligence). Machine "learns" how to do stuff by itsels.
	- A data scientist is also a macine learning scientist

# Topics in machine learning
	- **Regressions**: Predict a real value
	- **Classifications**: Predict a category
	- **Clustering**:
	- **Association rule learning:** associations and logic in the business to create value
	- **Reinforcement learning**
	- **Deep learning:** Facial, voice recognition (more python than R).
	- **Natural language processing!**: Text, analyzing feelings.
	- **Dimensional antireduction:** Get the important variables in the data.

# Data pre-processing **(without it your machine learning model won't work properly)**.
