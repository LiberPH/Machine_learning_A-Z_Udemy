# Machine_learning_A-Z_Udemy
Code and information of the machine learning course :D

## A little of history

- From the dawn of time to 2005, humans had generated 130 exabytes
- From the dawn of time to 2010, humans had genrated 1,200 exabytes
- In 2015, humans had generated 7900 exabytes
- In 2020 it is expected that humans will have generated 40,900 exabytes

## 6 Extra about instructors and stuff

- **Super datascience podcast O.o**: https://www.superdatascience.com/sds-002-machine-learning-recommender-systems-and-the-future-of-data-with-hadelin-de-ponteves/
- **What is Machine Learning**: 
	Can be used for: 
	- Predictions
	- Discover logic in a field (clustering and segmentation)
	- Interactive machine learning (choose best adds at the right moment, reinforcement learning)
	- Deep learning.
	- Big science that englobes many fields (AI can be defined the same way as artificial intelligence). Machine "learns" how to do stuff by itsels.
	- A data scientist is also a macine learning scientist

# Topics in machine learning
	- **Regressions**: Predict a real value
	- **Classifications**: Predict a category
	- **Clustering**:
	- **Association rule learning:** associations and logic in the business to create value
	- **Reinforcement learning**
	- **Deep learning:** Facial, voice recognition (more python than R).
	- **Natural language processing!**: Text, analyzing feelings.
	- **Dimensional antireduction:** Get the important variables in the data.

# Data pre-processing **(without it your machine learning model won't work properly)**.

## **IMPORTANT: Differentiate between dependent and independent variables**
In any machine learning model we are going to use independent variables to predict a dependent variable

## **Importing libraries**

### Python

Main libraries to be used:

- numpy as np: includes mathematical tools
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt: make nice plots
- pandas as pd: import and manage datasets

## Importing data sets

The first data set to work with is:

| Country | Age | Salary | Purchased | 
|---------|-----|--------|-----------| 
| France  | 44  | 72000  | No        | 
| Spain   | 27  | 48000  | Yes       | 
| Germany | 30  | 54000  | No        | 
| Spain   | 38  | 61000  | No        | 
| Germany | 40  |        | Yes       | 
| France  | 35  | 58000  | Yes       | 
| Spain   |     | 52000  | No        | 
| France  | 48  | 79000  | Yes       | 
| Germany | 50  | 83000  | No        | 
| France  | 37  | 67000  | Yes       | 

Where: country, age and salary are dependent variables


### Python

```python

#Data Preprocessing

## Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')

```

Once done this, it is important to separate the matrix of features from the dependent variable vector (i don't know why, R doesn't need of this):

```python

#Creating the matrix of features (all but last column)
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values

#Create the dependent variable vector
y = dataset.iloc[:, 3].values

#df.iloc[start row:end row,start column:end column],so,basically it helps in returning a specific rows and columns of the dataset df.
 

```


**Important for machine learning:** Discriminate between the matrix of features and the independent variable vector.

Things about object oriented programming that they mentioned in the tutorial and I ususally forget:

A class is the model of something we want to build. For example, if we make a house construction plan that gathers the instructions on how to build a house, then this construction plan is the class.

An object is an instance of the class. So if we take that same example of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. A house (the object) that was built by following the instructions of the construction plan (the class).
And therefore there can be many objects of the same class, because we can build many houses from the construction plan.

A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action. So in this same example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if a guest is coming. A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto the object, takes some inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.


**Difference between python and R:** Arrays in R start in 1, while in pyton they start in 0.

### R

You only need to set the directory (setwd) and read the data with read.csv (no pain here). I don't know why you don't need to separate the matrix of features (dependent) from the independent variable vector.

## Missing data O.o

Options:
1. Remove the lines with missing data (DANGEROUS, this could contain crucial information).
2. Replace missing data with the mean of the column where the missing data appears (in python a library does it for you).

### In python
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
#axis means column=0 row=1
imputer = Imputer(missing_values = 'NaN', strategy = "mean", axis = 0)
imputer = imputer.fit(X[:,1:3]) #The upper bound is excluded O.o
X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])
```

### In R

```R
#Set working directory
setwd("~/...")

#Importing dataset
dataset <-read.csv("Data.csv")

#Taking care of missing values in Age
dataset$Age = ifelse(is.na(dataset$Age),
                    ave(dataset$Age, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                    dataset$Age)
```
